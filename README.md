# My Bug Bounty & Web Security Study Notes

This repository is my central knowledge base for web application security and bug bounty hunting. I use it to store all my notes, lab files, code snippets, and writeups from my studies.

## üìö About This Repository

The main goal of this repo is to:
* Track my learning progress in web security.
* Organize my notes on different vulnerability classes.
* Build a portfolio of my lab work and projects to show my skills.
